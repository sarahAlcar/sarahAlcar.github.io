Hey there! I'm a Computer Scientist with a passion for research. I'm currently working towards my PhD, but let me take you on a quick journey through my adventures so far.

My journey began at PUC Minas, where I explored the world of computing and its various applications. During this time, I was fortunate to join the IMScience Lab, where I sharpened my skills in image processing techniques, particularly in image reconstruction. Continuing my academic pursuit, I pursued my Master's degree at UNICAMP, focusing on the classification of action videos. There, I delved into using deep learning and extracting high-level features to enhance classification accuracy.

Now, at Université Gustave Eiffel, I'm immersed in my PhD research, specializing in prediction networks and applying them for traffic speed forecasting. Specifically, I'm focusing on leveraging regional topography to predict traffic flow in areas lacking direct traffic information.

In addition to working on these topics, I'm also deeply interested in understanding the capabilities of generative networks. I'm also passionate about brainstorming projects that could benefit various fields like medicine, biology, and safety ... Moreover, my imaginative nature drives me towards exploring creative computing as well.

My ultimate goal is to keep advancing and become a top-notch researcher. I'm determined to use my expertise in computer science and machine learning to uncover new insights and have a positive impact on the world.
